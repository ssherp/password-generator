## Learning Points 
By implementing a password generator, I gained insights into the following aspects of password security:

Length and complexity: I learned how to generate passwords with an appropriate length and complexity to ensure they are difficult to guess or crack. This involves using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Randomness: I explored techniques to generate random passwords that are not predictable or based on easily guessable patterns. Understanding the importance of randomness in password generation helped me avoid common pitfalls.

Usability: While focusing on security, I also learned the significance of password usability. I discovered ways to strike a balance between generating secure passwords and ensuring they are easy to remember for the users. Techniques such as mnemonic phrases or passphrases can enhance both security and usability.
